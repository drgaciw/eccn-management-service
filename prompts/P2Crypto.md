Prompt 2: Classifying Encryption and Cryptographic Functionality
“Given our software includes encryption for secure payments and data protection, perform a detailed classification exercise referencing Category 5—Part 2 of the CCL. Outline the technical characteristics (e.g., key lengths, cryptographic libraries) that determine if our product falls under 5D002 or other related ECCN entries. Provide justifications based on exact EAR sections.”

Key Points

Review encryption strengths, functionalities, and licensing exceptions.
Cite specific subsections of 5D002 or alternative ECCNs if applicable.
Differentiate mass-market encryption (5D992) scenarios vs. controlled encryption (5D002).
