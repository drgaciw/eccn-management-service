Prompt 6: Assessing Risks and Red Flags
“Highlight potential red flags in our ECCN classification process for banking, payments, and fraud software. Consider restricted end-use cases, potential high-risk users, or embedded third-party components. Recommend a risk assessment framework to detect these issues early and mitigate any export control violations.”

Key Points

Identify restricted end-uses or entities (e.g., sanctioned countries or parties).
Integrate vendor/third-party software checks.
Establish monitoring processes for ongoing compliance.
