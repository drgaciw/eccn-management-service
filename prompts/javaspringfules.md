# Java and Spring Boot Best Practices

## Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented Java code with accurate Spring Boot examples.
- Adhere to the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
- Implement RESTful API design patterns when creating web services.
- Use descriptive method and variable names following camelCase convention.
- Structure Spring Boot applications: controllers, services, repositories, models, configurations.
- Aim for high cohesion within modules and low coupling between modules.
- Use interfaces to define contracts for services and repositories.

## Spring Boot Specifics
- Leverage Spring Boot starters for quick project setup and dependency management.
- Implement proper use of annotations (e.g., @SpringBootApplication, @RestController, @Service, @Repository).
- Utilize Spring Boot's auto-configuration features effectively.
- Implement proper exception handling using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler.
- Use Spring Profiles for environment-specific configurations.

## Lombok Usage
- Use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code, but don't overuse it at the expense of readability.
- Prefer @Getter and @Setter over @Data to have more control over which fields are mutable.
- Use @RequiredArgsConstructor for dependency injection instead of @Autowired.
- Implement @Builder for complex objects with many optional parameters.
- Use @Slf4j for easy logging setup.
- Be cautious with @EqualsAndHashCode, especially with JPA entities. Exclude non-id fields if necessary.
- Utilize @Value for immutable classes.
- Remember to install the Lombok plugin in your IDE for proper support.

## MongoDB with Spring Boot
- Use Spring Data MongoDB for seamless integration with MongoDB.
- Annotate your document classes with @Document and specify the collection name.
- Use @Id for the primary key field, typically using String or ObjectId type.
- Leverage @Field annotation to specify custom field names in the document.
- Use MongoRepository interface for basic CRUD operations and query methods.
- Implement custom queries using @Query annotation when needed.
- Use @Indexed for frequently queried fields to improve performance.
- Implement proper exception handling for MongoDB-specific exceptions.
- Use MongoDB transactions for operations that require atomicity.
- Configure MongoDB connection details in application.properties or application.yml.

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., UserController, OrderService).
- Use camelCase for method and variable names (e.g., findUserById, isOrderValid).
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants (e.g., MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS, DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE).
- Follow Spring's naming conventions for beans and components.
- For MongoDB collections, use lowercase with underscores (e.g., user_profiles).

## Java and Spring Boot Usage
- Utilize Java 17 or later features when applicable (e.g., records, sealed classes, pattern matching, text blocks).
- Leverage Spring Boot 3.x features and best practices.
- Implement proper validation using Bean Validation (e.g., @Valid, custom validators).
- Utilize functional programming concepts where appropriate (e.g., streams, lambda expressions).

## Configuration and Properties
- Use application.properties or application.yml for configuration, preferring YAML for complex configurations.
- Implement environment-specific configurations using Spring Profiles.
- Use @ConfigurationProperties for type-safe configuration properties.
- Externalize sensitive configuration using environment variables or a secure configuration server.

## Dependency Injection and IoC
- Prefer constructor injection over field injection for better testability and immutability.
- Leverage Spring's IoC container for managing bean lifecycles.
- Use @Autowired sparingly, favoring constructor injection or Lombok's @RequiredArgsConstructor.

## Testing
- Write unit tests using JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test.
- Use MockMvc for testing web layers.
- Implement integration tests using @SpringBootTest.
- Use @DataMongoTest for MongoDB repository tests.
- Implement parameterized tests for thorough test coverage.
- Use test containers for integration tests involving MongoDB or other services.
- Mock Lombok-generated methods when necessary in unit tests.

## Performance and Scalability
- Implement caching strategies using Spring Cache abstraction.
- Use async processing with @Async for non-blocking operations.
- Implement proper MongoDB indexing for frequently queried fields.
- Consider using reactive programming with Spring WebFlux and MongoDB Reactive drivers for high-concurrency scenarios.
- Implement pagination for large data sets in API responses.

## Security
- Implement Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- Use proper password encoding (e.g., BCrypt).
- Implement CORS configuration when necessary.
- Use HTTPS for all production endpoints.
- Implement rate limiting and API keys for public APIs.
- Be cautious with Lombok's @ToString to avoid exposing sensitive information.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Use SLF4J with Logback for logging, facilitated by Lombok's @Slf4j.
- Implement proper log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG).
- Use Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring and metrics.
- Implement distributed tracing for microservices architectures.
- Set up MongoDB query logging for performance monitoring in development environments.

## API Documentation
- Use Springdoc OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) for API documentation.
- Provide clear and concise descriptions for all API endpoints.
- Include example requests and responses in the API documentation.

## Data Access and ORM
- Use Spring Data MongoDB for database operations.
- Implement proper document relationships and embedding strategies.
- Use MongoDB change streams for real-time data changes when necessary.
- Implement auditing for document changes using Spring Data MongoDB's auditing capabilities.

## Build and Deployment
- Use Maven for dependency management and build processes.
- Implement proper profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod).
- Use Docker for containerization and Docker Compose for multi-container applications including MongoDB.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.

## Microservices Best Practices (if applicable)
- Design loosely coupled services with well-defined boundaries.
- Implement service discovery and registration using Spring Cloud.
- Use circuit breakers (e.g., Resilience4j) for fault tolerance.
- Implement centralized logging and monitoring for distributed systems.
- Consider using MongoDB as a shared database cautiously, preferring service-specific databases when possible.

## Code Quality and Maintenance
- Use static code analysis tools like SonarQube or SpotBugs, configuring them to work well with Lombok-generated code.
- Implement code formatting rules and use tools like Prettier or Google Java Format.
- Regularly update dependencies, including Lombok and MongoDB driver versions.
- Conduct code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge.
- Document Lombok usage clearly for team members who might be unfamiliar with it.
