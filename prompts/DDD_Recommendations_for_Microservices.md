# Domain-Driven Design Recommendations for ECCN Microservices

These recommendations guide the development of a microservices architecture for Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) management within a banking, payments, and fraud environment. We'll focus on bounded contexts, ubiquitous language, strategic design (core vs. supporting), and tactical design patterns.

---

## 1. Identify Bounded Contexts

We'll clearly define each bounded context as a dedicated section:

### 1.1. ECCN Classification Context

*   **Purpose:** This context manages the process of determining and assigning the correct ECCN to products or services. It's the heart of ECCN management, ensuring accurate classification according to regulations.
*   **Key Entities:**
    *   **Product:** (Might be a link or reference to a Product Catalog in another context)
    *   **ECCN Rule:** Represents the criteria for assigning an ECCN based on product characteristics.
    *   **ECCN Decision Tree:** A structured guide used in the classification process.
    *   **Assigned ECCN:** The final ECCN assigned to a product, potentially with an audit trail.
*   **Key Actions/Behaviors:**
    *   `ClassifyProduct(Product, Criteria)`
    *   `UpdateECCNRule(Rule)`
    *   `ValidateClassification(AssignedECCN)`
*   **Ubiquitous Language:**
    *   **Classification:** The process of determining the appropriate ECCN.
    *   **EAR (Export Administration Regulations):** The governing regulations for export control.
    *   **Dual-use:** Goods or technologies that have both commercial and military applications.
    *   **Catch-all:** A provision that covers items not specifically listed in ECCN categories.
*   **Integrations:** May integrate with external systems providing regulatory updates or product information.

### 1.2. Export Risk Assessment Context

*   **Purpose:** This context evaluates the risk associated with exporting a product to a specific destination and/or end-user. It ensures that transactions involving classified products are screened for potential violations.
*   **Key Entities:**
    *   **Sanction List:** Lists of individuals, entities, and countries subject to export restrictions.
    *   **Destination Risk Profile:** Risk level associated with a specific country or region.
    *   **End-User Risk Profile:** Risk level associated with a specific customer or entity.
    *   **Transaction:** Represents a specific export transaction (potentially linked to a Payments or Transaction Monitoring context).
    *   **Risk Assessment:** The result of evaluating the risk of a transaction.
*   **Key Actions/Behaviors:**
    *   `AssessTransactionRisk(Transaction)`
    *   `UpdateSanctionList(List)`
    *   `GenerateRiskReport(Transaction)`
*   **Ubiquitous Language:**
    *   **Sanction Screening:** The process of checking transactions against sanction lists.
    *   **Red Flag:** An indicator of potential export control violation.
    *   **False Positive:** A legitimate transaction flagged as a potential violation.
    *   **Denied Party:** An individual or entity prohibited from receiving exports.
*   **Integrations:**
    *   Connects with **Transaction Monitoring** and **Payment Processing** contexts to screen transactions.
    *   Integrates with external sanctions list providers.

### 1.3. Product Portfolio Management Context

*   **Purpose:** This context manages the catalog of products offered, including their ECCN classifications and relevant export control information. It provides a single source of truth for product data.
*   **Key Entities:**
    *   **Product:** (Maintains comprehensive product details).
    *   **Product Category:** Hierarchical classification of products.
    *   **Product ECCN Assignment:** Links a product to its assigned ECCN.
    *   **Product Documentation:** Storage of relevant technical specifications, marketing material, etc.
*   **Key Actions/Behaviors:**
    *   `AddProduct(Product)`
    *   `UpdateProduct(Product)`
    *   `AssignECCNtoProduct(Product, AssignedECCN)`
    *   `RetrieveProductDetails(Product)`
*   **Ubiquitous Language:**
    *   **Product Lifecycle Management (PLM):** The process of managing a product from inception to retirement.
    *   **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit):** Unique identifier for a product.
    *   **Technical Specifications:** Detailed description of a product's characteristics.
*   **Integrations:**
    *   Feeds into the **ECCN Classification Context**.
    *   Could integrate with other enterprise systems (e.g., ERP, CRM).

### 1.4. Compliance Operations and Audit Context

*   **Purpose:** This context manages the workflows, audits, reporting, and record-keeping related to ECCN compliance. It ensures that all activities are tracked, documented, and auditable.
*   **Key Entities:**
    *   **Compliance Workflow:** Defines the steps in a compliance process (e.g., ECCN review, license application).
    *   **Audit Log:** Records all actions related to ECCN management.
    *   **Compliance Report:** Generated reports to demonstrate compliance.
    *   **License:** (If applicable) Manages export licenses.
*   **Key Actions/Behaviors:**
    *   `InitiateComplianceWorkflow(ProcessName, Data)`
    *   `LogAuditEvent(Event)`
    *   `GenerateComplianceReport(ReportType, Parameters)`
    *   `ApplyForLicense(LicenseApplication)`
*   **Ubiquitous Language:**
    *   **Audit Trail:** A chronological record of activities.
    *   **Due Diligence:** The process of investigating and verifying compliance.
    *   **Record Retention Policy:** Rules governing the storage and disposal of records.
    *   **License Exception:** An authorization that permits export under certain conditions without a license.
*   **Integrations:**
    *   Receives data from all other ECCN-related contexts for auditing and reporting.
    *   May integrate with external systems for license management.

## 2. Strategic Design: Core vs. Supporting Domains

### 2.1. Core Domains:

*   **ECCN Classification:** This is *the* core domain. Accurate and efficient classification is the foundation of the entire ECCN management process. Invest heavily in modeling, automation, and performance here.
*   **Export Risk Assessment:** Equally critical. This domain directly protects the organization from legal and financial repercussions. Its effectiveness is paramount.

### 2.2. Supporting Domains:

*   **Product Portfolio Management:** While crucial for providing context to the core domains, it's a supporting domain. It can be built using more standard catalog management patterns. Consider integrations with existing product information systems.
*   **Compliance Operations and Audit:** This domain is essential for governance and record-keeping but does not drive the core ECCN process. It can leverage existing workflow and reporting tools where possible, augmented with domain-specific logic.

## 3. Tactical Design Patterns

### 3.1. Aggregates

*   **ECCN Classification Context:**
    *   `ECCN Rule` (Root) + `Criteria` (Value Objects)
    *   `Product` (Root, if not sourced from another context) + `Assigned ECCN`
*   **Export Risk Assessment Context:**
    *   `Transaction` (Root, if not sourced from another context) + `Risk Assessment`
*   **Product Portfolio Management Context:**
    *   `Product` (Root) + `Product ECCN Assignment`
*   **Compliance Operations and Audit Context:**
    *   `Compliance Workflow` (Root) + `Workflow Steps`

### 3.2. Domain Events

*   `ProductClassified` (Published by ECCN Classification, Subscribed by Product Portfolio, Compliance Operations)
*   `TransactionRiskAssessed` (Published by Export Risk Assessment, Subscribed by Transaction Processing, Compliance Operations)
*   `SanctionListUpdated` (Published by Export Risk Assessment, Subscribed by Compliance Operations, possibly other risk-related systems)
*   `ComplianceWorkflowCompleted` (Published by Compliance Operations, used internally and potentially by external reporting systems)

### 3.3. Context Mapping

*   **Partnership:** Between ECCN Classification and Export Risk Assessment. Both are core and highly interdependent.
*   **Customer/Supplier:** Product Portfolio Management is a *Supplier* to ECCN Classification (which is the *Customer*). The Classification context needs well-defined product data.
*   **Conformist:** Compliance Operations and Audit largely conforms to the data structures and events produced by other contexts.
*   **Anticorruption Layer:** Could be used when integrating with external systems, such as those providing regulatory updates or sanction lists, to ensure data integrity and prevent external models from corrupting the internal domain model.

### 3.4. Sagas

*   **Long-Running Classification Process:** If classifying a complex product involves multiple steps and human review, a saga could manage the overall process, potentially involving interactions between ECCN Classification and Compliance Operations contexts.
*   **License Application Process:** A saga can orchestrate the process of applying for an export license, coordinating tasks across different contexts (Compliance Operations, potentially an external License Management system).

## Summary

This improved set of recommendations provides a more detailed and actionable roadmap for designing ECCN microservices using DDD. It emphasizes:

*   **Clear Bounded Contexts:** Each context has a well-defined purpose, responsibilities, and a ubiquitous language.
*   **Strategic Alignment:** Core domains receive the most attention, while supporting domains are designed to enable them effectively.
*   **Tactical Design Patterns:** Aggregates, domain events, context mapping, and sagas are applied to create a cohesive and scalable architecture.

By following these guidelines, you can build a robust, maintainable, and adaptable ECCN management system that meets the stringent requirements of the banking, payments, and fraud environment while ensuring compliance with export regulations.
