Prompt 4: Implementing an Automated Classification Tool
“Design an automated tool for ECCN classification integrated into our software development lifecycle. Outline the methods to capture details (e.g., encryption libraries used, payment processing modules), compare against ECCN criteria, and generate alerts for potential classification changes. Describe how the tool would track and store classification history.”

Key Points

Automate data ingestion and analysis of cryptographic elements.
Maintain audit trails of classification decisions.
Provide real-time alerts for developers and compliance personnel.
